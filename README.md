## Introduction

This project shows how to use [reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html), a markup language
slightly more complex than Markdown, to document a Python project.

Except for this `README.md`, the project itself is documented in `rst`. The entry-point of the documentations are
[index.rst](docs/source/index.rst).

The `.rst` files have been built into HTMLs and published to GitHub Pages. Check it out
[here](https://ascending-llc.github.io/rst-demo/).
